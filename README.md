# Annual-Income-Prediction
Here we are using dataset that contains the information about individuals from various countries. Our target is to predict whether a person makes <=50k or >50k annually on basis of the other information available. Dataset consists of 32561 observations and 14 features describing individuals. We are evaluating the prediction on ROC_AUC

I am using LightGBM and will also show you the difference why LightGBM is better than XGboost.

I am also explaining all the evalusation metrics like ROC_Auc,Gini,KS Score, Concaordance, Precision_recall_f1 score

Here is the link to the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult.
